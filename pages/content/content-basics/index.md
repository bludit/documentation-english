# Content basics
<!-- position: 1 -->

Bludit has five types of content.

<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
The pages can be treated as a regular `page` or a `post` (blog post). In the end, the concept of `page` is just a name. The pages have the ability to be ordered by `date` or by `position`.

For example, if you are interested in creating a blog, you can order the pages by `date`. If you are interested in creating a website with the pages in a specific order, you can order the pages by `position`.

Bludit orders the pages by `date` by default, but you can change this from the settings by going to **Settings > General > Advanced > Order content by**.

<h2 id="static">Static</h2>
The static pages have the feature to not appear in the homepage, but are published and can be accessed via the URL. These kind of pages are useful for pages such as `About`, `Terms and conditions`, `Privacy` or `Contact us`. The themes generally show a link to this pages in the top bar.

To create this kind of page, while you are creating the content, go to the tab **Options** and select the type **Type > Static**.

<h2 id="sticky">Sticky</h2>
The sticky pages are the same as a normal page, but have the feature to appear in the top of the published pages.

<h2 id="scheduled">Scheduled</h2>

To select the date, go to the tab **Options** and set the date in the field **Date** while you are creating the content.
